SaaStr Fund invests in 4-5 awesome SaaS start-ups a year, generally in the $0.1m to $2m ARR range.  Before $10k MRR is usually a bit too early for us, and after $2m ARR or so is usually a bit late and Series A.

Pre-revenue is too early.  We can only invest if you have at least 10 Unaffiliated Customers, and ideally, $10k+ or more in MRR.

We invest in founders that are a part of the SaaStr community.  That’s probably you if you got here :). But if you’ve never heard of SaaStr, never read a SaaStr post, heard our podcast, or been to one of our events ... there are probably better sources of capital.

We are OK with startups based anywhere in the world (SaaS has flattened), but prefer folks that come to Bay Area frequently.  It does make it easier to recruit, fundraise, partner, etc.  At least in normal times.  ",VC,$500000,$4000000

Our investment hypothesis centers around finding the best people working on commercially sound business models. This philosophy of not just singularly optimizing on growth metrics but considering long-term viability of the business while still achieving digital category leadership within a c. 5-8 year timeframe, is what we call “True Growth”. 

Furthermore, we focus our investments on cases where it is evident that we can provide “smart money”. I.e. opportunities where the competencies of our group are strongly relevant to get the company on a true, sustained, commercial growth trajectory. We leverage key learnings from scaling our own ventures (everyone in our group is an operator!) to global importance while retaining robust unit economics in order to pick investments and support our portfolio founders.

New Orleans BioInnovation Center,https://neworleansbio.com/,"1441 Canal St, New Orleans, LA 70112",USA,"1. Idea or Patent,2. Prototype,3. Early Revenue","We work on behalf of the US federal government to source startups related to the BARDA DRIVe program. Funding can be up to $750K through the program. Current types of companies we are looking for:

Digital MCMs: Develop novel digital technologies that accelerate the response to health security threats. Proposed solutions should increase access, reduce cost, or more rapidly disseminate medical countermeasures, such as diagnosis and risk assessment capabilities, by:
 Capitalizing on broadly available and easily accessible digital platforms such as smartphones and web applications and/or
 Combining novel analytic approaches, such as AI/ML, with broadly accessible data sources such as images, audio, sensors, or user data from smartphones/wearable devices; or other novel digital data sources.
Digital health tools include smartphone, web, and telehealth applications, data sets, or algorithms that are deployable on commonly available digital devices.

Healing Lungs: Address gaps in ARDS treatment by developing innovative technologies that enable oxygen delivery and gas exchange for severe ARDS patients, prevent secondary lung injury, and do not resort to mechanical ventilation or positive air pressure systems.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients not responding to mechanical ventilation are placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a last resort. This intervention remains labor-intensive, costly, high risk, and is only available at a few specialized centers. DRIVe envisions improved access to affordable, effective, and safe treatment options like ECMO that can be administered outside of the intensive care unit, for severe ARDS patients. Healing Lungs seeks to develop next-generation ECMO advances and oxygen delivery vehicles superior to currently available interventions.

Host-based Diagnostics: When health is compromised by an infection or injury, the body's response can trigger a cascade of protective activities. Host-based diagnostics (HBDs) focus on these responses, not the threat itself, providing a threat agnostic complement to pathogen-based diagnostics. They can aid clinical decision making by providing insight into a patient's past infectious status, current immunity, infection severity, or future status, including the trajectory of deterioration to severe outcomes (eg; sepsis). These threat agnostic approaches not only have potential to map an individual patient's status- HBDs can also help address existing gaps in our ability to respond to unidentified threats.This program will bolster national preparedness by supporting the development, validation, and regulatory approval of host-based tools and approaches, with an emphasis on assessment of the clinical utility. HBDs encompass a broad range of technologies capable of leveraging various data types from an individual such as genomic biomarkers, cellular responses and physiological data, which may be analyzed by integrated algorithms.
Our current areas of focus include:
Pathogen agnostic detection of infection, severity, or health deterioration in clinical settings outside of the hospital
Demonstrate the clinical utility of HBDs for changing patient outcomes
Utilize methods (e.g., cell-mediated immunity, epigenetic markers) that can inform on a patient's prior infectious status or current status of immunity
Stratification of patient subpopulations to guide clinical trial design or identify appropriate treatment

Host-Directed Therapeutics: When health is compromised by infection, insult, or injury, the body's response can trigger a cascade of immune dysregulation and organ dysfunction, leading to poor patient outcomes. Treatments aimed at modulating these responses, known as host-directed therapeutics (HDTs), have the potential to prevent, reduce or mitigate immediate and long-term harm through promoting a balance of healthy cells, tissue, immune system or organ function.HDTs by design target universal responses, representing a threat agnostic approach for a variety of health security threats, including pandemics. They offer a significant advantage for pandemic preparedness by eliminating the need for pathogen identification and pathogen specific treatment, which is a critical capability when facing an emerging or previously unknown pathogen. While HDTS may be used for the treatment of non-infectious conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, autoimmune disorders, oncology), they have not been widely applied to health security problems due to perceived challenges in development or ROI. To catalyze broader implementation of HDTs, we are supporting development of new or repurposed drugs, biologics, or devices.
Our current areas of HDT focus include:
Interventions to prevent or reduce infection progression to severe outcomes
Therapies that improve long term outcomes and prevent health deterioration
Patient stratification to subtype populations for improved clinical management.

Home Diagnostics: Telehealth is now widespread, but most routine testing still requires visits to a clinic or lab. This program is developing disruptive platform technologies to collect and analyze biological samples at home. This technology could revolutionize diagnostics, chronic disease management, and even clinical research, providing better access to care and a more disaster-resilient health care system. 
Support the development and validation of new platform technologies for simple, rapid multiplexed analysis of biological specimens in the home setting.
These novel technologies:
Use non-invasive and minimally invasive samples to provide quantitative information about a patient's health status
Are readily adaptable to a broad menu of test panels to cover a wide range of disease states as well as standard health assessments
Offer rapid results for interpretation by health care providers.

Anti-viral therapies are a critical medical countermeasure against acute viral infections and their long-term sequelae. For many viruses, such as filoviruses, the commercial market provides limited incentives for product developers to evaluate promising candidates. Antiviral therapeutics are generally advanced for a single indication, however they may have efficacy against multiple related viruses due to conserved mechanisms and host/virus proteins.

With the Repurposing Drugs for Biological Threats (ReBooT) program, DRIVe and BARDA's Antivirals and Antitoxins (AVAT) branch aim to support the testing and evaluation of candidate antiviral therapeutics that have been licensed or developed past Phase 1 clinical trials for another indication, but which have a mechanism of action likely to be effective against filoviruses.Drug repurposing, or label expansion, is a strategy that is used to identify new uses for approved or late-stage therapeutics beyond their original clinical indication. With ReBooT, efforts are focused on repurposing safe direct-acting and host-directed therapeutics that have the potential to reduce the mordidity and mortality associated with filovirus infection.
Program funding will support proof of concept studies and help fill critical knowledge gaps to include:
Identifying candidates that can be repurposed, either licensed or beyond Phase 1, with a mechanism of action suggestive of efficacy against the filoviruses
Supporting critical evaluations to determine if the candidate warrants future consideration for product development

Strengthening our ability to respond to physical threats is a critical part of BARDA's strategy. Exposure to substantial doses of ionizing radiation, causes widespread cell death and leads to a spectrum of injuries across multiple organs, also known as Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS). Due to the systemic multi-organ pathologies of ARS, fast-acting, effective medical countermeasures (MCM) are needed.
With the Repurposing and Advancing Innovations Against Rad/Nuc (RePAIR) program, DRIVe and BARDA's Chemical, Biological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Division aim to support the testing and evaluation of repurposed drugs that have potential efficacy against ARS.Drug repurposing, or label expansion, is a strategy that is used to identify new uses for approved or late-stage therapeutics beyond their original clinical indication. With RePAIR, efforts are focused on repurposing licensed or late-stage therapeutics as MCMs against ARS.
This includes therapeutics for treating:
Cell Death
Vascular Injury
Bleeding/Coagulation
Ischemia

At Couchpotato, we believe that exceptional founders are the driving force behind transformative companies. Our mission is to empower ambitious entrepreneurs by providing patient capital and hands-on support in the earliest stages of startup journeys.

We invest pre-seed and seed, writing $100K checks as a founder's first outside capital. This enables entrepreneurs to get started and gain momentum without substantial dilution.

In addition to flexible financing, we take an active role in helping de-risk the startup process. Our team of experienced operators advises on growth, product-market fit, hiring key roles, forming partnerships, and raising future rounds.

We leverage our network to connect portfolio companies with advisors, customers, technical talent and follow-on investors. By sharing playbooks and facilitating pilot projects, we help founders avoid common pitfalls.

Our ideal founders are relentless learners who demonstrate grit, creativity and vision. We believe diverse, well-rounded teams outperform those with narrow expertise. Founders we back question assumptions, communicate effectively, and balance passion with pragmatism.

We designed Couchpotato to provide maximum autonomy with accountability. Our founder-friendly terms empower startups to take risks and maintain control. We drive alignment through transparency and only succeed when our portfolio succeeds.

If you are an ambitious innovator ready to take the leap, we want to fund you on your journey. Let’s build the future together, $100K check at a time.",Angel network,$10000,$100000

Our fund's objective is to provide long - term capital appreciation for our investors. In pursuing this objective, we seek to provide our investors with a diverse selection of high - quality, efficiently managed tech companies within managed risk controlled models.
Under normal market conditions, we intend to invest the majority of the fund's capital into private tech companies, with remarkable scale and ascendant market share, which are sourced through fundamental financial analysis, data mining, pattern recognition and proprietary financial models. We then look for forward - looking stimulus that we believe will hasten earnings and/ or enhance the company's assets. Forward - looking stimulus may include but are not limited to; new, improved, or unique products or services; new or rapidly expanding markets for the company's products; new management; changes in the economic, financial, political, or regulatory environment affecting the company; or a business strategy not recognised by the market or competitors.

• Data and Analytics: We look for data ingest technologies, developer tooling for AI and ML, understandable AI systems, analytic workflow tools, analytics to control automated processes, and decision analytics. Data need to be helpful in various environments in a way that addresses a wide range of latency concerns. As a result, we seek technologies that adapt analytic workflows to accommodate processing constraints and support the development of just-in-time, good-enough analytical strategies.
• Cybersecurity: We look for end-point security systems, zero trust systems, novel access control and isolation mechanisms, application security, code analysis, and software-defined perimeters. Data protection deserves special attention to address security and privacy concerns and look for novel ways to protect data in motion and at rest.
• Computing: We look for technologies that enable high-performance computing from commodity resources, allow distributed and edge computing, support stream processing, and enable specialized processors. We also believe that compute requirements ebb and flow, so look for technologies that rapidly provision and configure compute resources.
• Networking: We look for technologies that heighten network adaptivity and enable computation distribution. This includes software-defined networking, edge networks, and 5G technologies. Adaptive networks need secure network controls, so look for technologies that support policy-driven networking and secure network configuration.",VC,$200000,$10000000
